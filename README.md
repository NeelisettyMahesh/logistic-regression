Logistic Regression - Binary Classification
This project demonstrates how to build a binary classification model using Logistic Regression on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset.


Steps Performed
Load Dataset
Preprocess Features using StandardScaler
Train/Test Split (80/20)
Train Logistic Regression Model


Evaluate using:
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
ROC-AUC Score
ROC Curve Plot


OUTPUT
logistic regression works for binary classification
Sigmoid function outputs probabilities
To interpret evaluation metrics like ROC-AUC
